# Shaun-Ang-Dreamer-Photographer-Creator

Iâ€™m currently based in Ho Chi Minh City or as people around me affectionately calls this city by its old name, Saigon. My primary body of work includes portrait, fashion and super heavily edited lifestyle photography.  As my take on portraits are based on natural lighting and shadows, I tend to use my Leica Q which more than meets my requirements.
Additionally, I started out in creative design, having taught myself various Adobe software as well as certain key photo editing apps.
Where people are indifferent to everyday objects or stuff to be taken for granted, sometimes, I see a challenge. I try my best to envision locations and products in a parallel universe, and draw a nice result from each shot I take.
